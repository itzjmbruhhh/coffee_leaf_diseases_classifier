                                Users begin by uploading a photo of a coffee leaf using the provided interface.
                                The image must be clear and taken in good lighting to ensure accurate results.

                                The uploaded image is processed by a <strong>highly accurate Convolutional Neural
                                    Network (CNN) model</strong>
                                trained using <strong>TensorFlow</strong>. The model analyzes the leaf and determines
                                its health statusâ€”
                                classifying it as <strong>Healthy</strong>, <strong>Miner</strong>,
                                <strong>Phoma</strong>, or <strong>Rust</strong>. Lean more about Tensorflow and Deeplearning <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs" target="_blank">here</a>.

                                Once classified, the system stores the following data into the database:

                                <li><strong>Date and Time</strong> the image was processed</li>
                                <li><strong>Confidence Level</strong> of the prediction (e.g., 97.2%)</li>

                                The results, including the image and its classification with the confidence score, are
